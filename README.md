# PoseCompare

**Visual Comparison Tool for Popular Pose Detection Models**

PoseCompare is a tool designed to visually compare the performance of popular pose detection models. It enables users to analyze pose landmarks, joint positions, and motion outputs to evaluate and contrast model accuracy, smoothness, and responsiveness.

## üìñ Overview

PoseCompare provides:
- Side-by-side visual comparisons of pose detection outputs.
- Landmark visualization and extracted motion rules.
- Model evaluation for fitness tracking, animation, and other computer vision applications.

**Supported Pose Detection Models:**
- ViTPose
- mediapipe
- 4DHumans

## üöÄ How to Install and Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Conda** (Anaconda or Miniconda)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- Internet access (for downloading model weights).

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/posecompare.git
   cd posecompare
   ```

2. **Set up the Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate posecompare_env
   ```

3. **Download model weights:**
   ```bash
   curl -o weights.pth https://your-model-weights-url.com/weights.pth
   ```

4. **Run the tool:**
   - Open the notebook interface:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook PoseCompare.ipynb
     ```
   - Or execute the notebook programmatically:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute PoseCompare.ipynb --output executed_PoseCompare.ipynb
     ```
